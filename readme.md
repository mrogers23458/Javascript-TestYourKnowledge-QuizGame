## Javascript Quiz Game with questions about Javascript
## Description
The goal of this project was to use Javascript to create a timed quiz game, where users would have to answers questions about Javascript within the allotted time. If the user was unable to answer all of the questions within the allotted time, the game will time out and they will be prompted to save their score. The score is based on the total number of correct answers. The game also tracks number of incorrect answers.

During this project I learned and applied a lot of Javascript. This included setting global and local variables, arrays, functions, if and if/else statements. Additionally I learned how to traverse the dom and use Javascript associated functions such as getElementById, querySelector, appendChild. I also learned how to create a timer using setInterval and values in ms. Finally, I learned how to use Javascript to update CSS elements which allowed me to hide portions of the quiz such as the questions and scoreboard until a click action happened. 
## Usage
To play the game click the Start Quiz button. This will begin a timer that gives 90 seconds to answer 3 questions about Javascript. Be careful when you answer though a wrong answer will deduct 10seconds from the timer.
